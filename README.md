# Application of power method for Matrices

### Power Method and Inverse Power Method

The Power method is an iterative technique used to determine the dominant eigenvalue of a matrixâ€”that is, the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude. One useful feature of the Power method is that it produces not only an eigenvalue but also an associated eigenvector. In fact,the Power method is often applied to find an eigenvector for an eigenvalue that is determined by some other means.
